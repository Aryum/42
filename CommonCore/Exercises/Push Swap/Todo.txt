1st organize stacks
	divide them in 4
		1st stack -> 4rd quarter and 3th quarter of stack
		2nd stack -> 1nd quarter and 2st quarter of stack

2nd organize divisions
	make a checker if the numbers are in sequence
		if both are then we can sort everyhting
	organize 4th and 1st quarters
		check moves than are cheapest
			check if you can move both stacks to make it simpler
